# SPOT_Plus

This is a proof of concept for SPOT+.

The SPOT+ system illustrates the potential that an integrated IoT system can have on enhancing space utilisation, operation efficiency and student experience in the library of Taylor University. A QR-based entry gate, camera-assisted seating recognition, edge detection with YOLO, and a secure cloud server allow SPOT + to offer students real-time information on the occupancy of libraries instantly with no violation of privacy
