# SPOT_Plus

The SPOT+ system illustrates the potential that an integrated IoT system can have on enhancing space utilisation, operation efficiency and student experience in the library of Taylor University. A QR-based entry gate, camera-assisted seating recognition, edge detection with YOLO, and a secure cloud server allow SPOT + to offer students real-time information on the occupancy of libraries instantly with no violation of privacy

![The video]([https://www.youtube.com/embed/<VIDEO_ID>]https://youtu.be/uwTAs78Bagg) shows the proof of concept for SPOT+ using a Panopto footage with a basic web interface. 

The following figure shows the basic web application. The web application shows the real-time zone occupancy on the record footage.
